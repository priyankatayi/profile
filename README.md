# My Profile Application 


As part of this project, I have developed a single page application to display my details.  I have displayed information about me in the following sections:

  - **About Me**- displaying my name, access to my LinkedIn profile.
  - **Skills, Education, Experience, Portfolio** â€“ it displays the projects I have worked on and when clicked on them, the links open in a new page. 
  - I have added **Endorse my Skills** functionality, where the user can hit the like button and then the number of votes is displayed and progress bar is also displayed which is calculated on basis of number of votes. This information is saved into the firebase database and then retrieved to update the information on the application. 
 - In the **Interests** section, I have added a slideshow which displays the images from my Instagram account. These pictures are retrieved by making an Ajax call to Instagram API 
 - The **Contact** section uses a modal that gives user the ability to provide the information and this data is saved onto the firebase database. I added a functionality to display the latest user name and their message right below the contact section that is being retrieved from database.
